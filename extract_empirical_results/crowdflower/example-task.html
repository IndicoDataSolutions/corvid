<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>In this job, you will be presented with <strong>abstracts</strong> from scientific papers in the <strong>computer science</strong> field. &nbsp;Sometimes, authors will report empirical results of their experiments as numbers in their abstracts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The goal is to identify whether each number in an abstract is an empirical result that is also relevant to a <strong>list of keywords</strong>.</p>
<hr>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>
	<li>Read the abstract and the list of keywords.</li>
	<li>For every highlighted number:

		<ol>
			<li>If it is an empirical result relevant to those keywords, toggle the checkbox for that number to be <strong>On</strong>.</li>
			<li>If it is not an empirical result and/or not relevant to those keywords, keep the checkbox toggled <strong>Off</strong>. &nbsp;</li>
			<li>If you're unsure, keep the checkbox toggled <strong>Off</strong> and write down the highlighted number in the text box below</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<h1>Rules &amp; Tips</h1>

<p>There are 3 situations to toggle a number <strong>Off:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>It is not an empirical result:

		<ol>
			<li>"In the year 1998"</li>
			<li>"The Mechabot2000"
				<br>
				<br>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>It might be an empirical result, but not relevant to this particular paper:

		<ol>
			<li>"The unemployment rate in America is 4%, which is motivation for why we decided to study this other thing"
				<br>
				<br>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>It is an empirical result of this paper's experiments, but not given the list of keywords:

		<ol>
			<li>"We achieved 90% accuracy on DatasetA" &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; &nbsp; &nbsp;keywords are "accuracy, DatasetB"</li>
			<li>"We achieved 90% accuracy using TechniqueA" &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; &nbsp; &nbsp;keywords are "accuracy, TechniqueB"</li>
			<li>"We achieved precision and recall of 1.0 and 1.0" &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; &nbsp; &nbsp;keywords are "f1-score"</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some tough cases:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"Other people achieved 90% accuracy with TechniqueA, but we achieved 91% accuracy with a slightly-modified TechniqueA" &nbsp; &amp; &nbsp; keywords are "accuracy, TechniqueA"</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, 91 is definitely a result, so toggled <strong>On</strong>. &nbsp;But the 90 could be tough to make a decision on. &nbsp;These are cases where it's fine to leave it toggled <strong>Off</strong>, and add "90" to the text field.</p>
